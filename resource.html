This connection is amplified in organizations implementing Relationship-Based Care (RBC), a patient care delivery model that has relationships with self and others as its central concept. A secondary analysis of data from 542 health-care workers in a health-care system in the northeastern United States was performed to identify a profile of staff factors that predict a caring connection as perceived by staff.</p>

                        <span>21 Oct 2016</span>
                        <p>Clarity of Self, Role and System is a newly developed tool that measures clarity for patient care providers as it relates to self, role and system. The instrument is based on work by Jayne Felgen and Mary Koloroutis. The “Clarity of Self” subscale was derived from another 40-item instrument that was established by Campbell et al. (1996). The other two subscales, “Clarity of Role” and “Clarity of System,” were co-created by the authors.</p>

                        <span>10 Nov 2016</span>
                        <p>The HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) Survey measures patient experience. It is an important survey because some of the hospitals’ payment is dependent on the scores. It was desired to know if use of caring theories could increase HCAHPS scores.</p>
